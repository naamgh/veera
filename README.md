# Indoor Training Console

A single-page indoor cycling app: a library of 500+ structured workouts, ERG control of a
smart trainer over Web Bluetooth, live power / heart rate / cadence, auto-pause, ramp and
20-minute FTP tests, and `.fit` + summary-image export for Strava.

Everything runs in the browser. There is no backend and nothing is uploaded: your FTP,
favourites and remembered devices stay in the browser's storage on your machine, and
exports download to your computer.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The app, with the workout library embedded |
| `manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js`, `icon*.png`, `icon.svg` | Make it installable and give it an offline fallback |
| `library-gen.js`, `library-builder.html` | Regenerate the workout library (optional) |
| `start-online.bat` | Windows launcher that enables one-click device reconnect (see below) |

## Publishing on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository (public — Pages on a private repo needs a paid plan).
2. Upload every file in this folder to the repository root.
3. In the repository: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**,
   branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`. Save.
4. After a minute or two the site is live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

To update the app later, upload the new `index.html` over the old one. Browsers pick it up
on the next open (the service worker is network-first, so a fresh copy always wins when
you're online).

## Using it

Open the URL in **Chrome or Edge** — Web Bluetooth isn't available in Firefox or Safari.
Chrome on Android works too; iPhone needs a third-party browser such as Bluefy.

Connect the trainer (and optionally a heart-rate strap), set your FTP, pick a workout and
press **Start Workout**. The Guide button at the bottom of the filter panel has the short
version of everything, including keyboard shortcuts.

**Install as an app:** in Chrome, the install icon in the address bar (or menu → *Install
Indoor Training Console*) gives you a frameless window and an icon in the Start menu.

### One-click reconnect (Windows)

Reconnecting to the same trainer and strap without the Bluetooth picker relies on two
Chrome features that are still behind flags. `start-online.bat` launches Chrome with the
switches that enable them, using its own profile folder so it works even if Chrome is
already open:

1. Edit `start-online.bat` and replace the placeholder URL with your Pages address.
2. Double-click it. The first connect goes through the picker; every launch after that
   shows **Reconnect trainer & HR**.

Without it, the app still works normally — you just pick the devices from the list each time.

## Regenerating the library

Open `library-builder.html` from the hosted site (or locally through a server), press
**Generate library**, review, then **Download index.html** and upload that over the
existing one.
